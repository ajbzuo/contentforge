<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Executives describe a budgeting season defined by caution: push critical bets forward, push nice-to-have projects back. Capital continues to flow toward durable cash generators while experimental projects face higher bars for approval. Several companies are rewriting service-level agreements to align incentives around uptime rather than raw volume.

<p>Executives describe a budgeting season defined by caution: push critical bets forward, push nice-to-have projects back. Balance sheets are sturdier than during the last shock, yet risk appetite has narrowed to proven categories. “Rules are catching up to reality, and reality keeps moving,” said a policy analyst tracking the dossier. Internal memos reviewed by managers call for weekly risk councils and daily scenario updates for key markets. Policy choices over the next two meetings will determine whether relief becomes a trend or a pause.</p>

<h2>By the Numbers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hiring intentions: steady-to-soft across consumer-facing firms</li>
<li>Input costs: easing in freight and components; higher in compliance and AI infrastructure</li>
<li>Lead times: compressed for standard SKUs; extended for custom parts</li>
<li>Inventories: trending leaner after Q2 clean-up cycles</li>
