speculation, India Champions Inclusive AI at Global South Summit arrived with fewer fireworks than feared but deeper consequences than most expected.\n\n## Background\n\nData over recent quarters has been noisy, masking weakening momentum beneath headline resilience. The institutional muscle memory developed since 2020—rapid planning, diversified suppliers, and live dashboards—has shortened response times. Internal memos reviewed by managers call for weekly risk councils and daily scenario updates for key markets. The biggest open question is consumer stamina—early indicators suggest restraint, not retreat.\n\nOfficials have wrestled for months with competing mandates, calibrating moves to avoid whipsawing fragile demand.

The institutional muscle memory developed since 2020—rapid planning, diversified suppliers, and live dashboards—has shortened response times.
