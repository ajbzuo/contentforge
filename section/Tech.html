The immediate effect is psychological: confidence determines whether decent fundamentals translate into investment. Procurement teams are shifting contracts to include flexible volume bands and faster dispute resolution clauses. If execution holds through the next quarter, the base case is orderly deceleration rather than a cliff.\n\nOfficials have wrestled for months with competing mandates, calibrating moves to avoid whipsawing fragile demand.
