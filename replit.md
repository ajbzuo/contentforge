# Overview

This is a full-stack news magazine web application built as a TIME-style publication. The application features a modern React frontend with a news article management system, category-based navigation, search functionality, and a responsive design. The backend is built with Express.js and includes database integration with PostgreSQL through Drizzle ORM, though it currently uses in-memory storage as the default implementation.

The application provides a complete news reading experience with featured articles, breaking news tickers, category sections, and individual article pages. It includes a comprehensive design system built with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript running on Vite for fast development and building
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing with routes for home, article detail, and category pages  
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management and data fetching
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom design system using CSS variables for theming
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library providing consistent, accessible components
- **Data Flow**: Custom hooks (useArticles, useArticle) manage article data with search and filtering capabilities

## Backend Architecture
- **Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript for the REST API
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL with schema-first approach
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer with in-memory implementation (MemStorage) and interface for database integration
- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints with `/api` prefix, error handling middleware, and request logging
- **Development Setup**: Hot module replacement with Vite integration in development mode

## Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL configured through Drizzle ORM with migrations support
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with Zod schema validation for type safety
- **Current Implementation**: In-memory storage (MemStorage) for development, easily swappable with database implementation
- **Schema**: User management with username/password authentication structure defined in shared schema

## Authentication and Authorization
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL session store (connect-pg-simple)
- **User Schema**: Basic user model with UUID primary keys, unique usernames, and password storage
- **Architecture**: Prepared for authentication implementation with user storage interface and schema validation

## External Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon Database serverless PostgreSQL for production deployment
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives for accessible component foundation
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod resolvers for form validation  
- **Image Assets**: Unsplash for article imagery and placeholder content
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts integration (Source Serif Pro, Inter, JetBrains Mono)
- **Development Tools**: Replit-specific plugins for development environment integration
- **Build Tools**: esbuild for server bundling, PostCSS for CSS processing

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend concerns, making it easy to extend functionality and integrate additional features like user authentication, content management, and real-time updates.
