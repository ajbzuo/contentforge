# Deploy TIME Replica to Vercel

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to deploy your TIME Magazine replica website to Vercel.

## Prerequisites

- Vercel account (sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com))
- Vercel CLI installed globally: `npm install -g vercel`
- Your project code ready (already set up in this Replit)

## Option 1: Deploy via Vercel CLI (Recommended)

### Step 1: Login to Vercel
```bash
vercel login
```
Follow the prompts to authenticate with your Vercel account.

### Step 2: Deploy from Replit
Run this command in your Replit terminal:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

The CLI will:
- Detect your project automatically  
- Ask you to link to an existing project or create a new one
- Build and deploy your application
- Provide you with deployment URLs

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables (if needed)
If your app requires any environment variables:
```bash
vercel env add
```

## Option 2: Deploy via GitHub Integration

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. In your Replit terminal, run:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - TIME replica website"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/time-replica.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Connect to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will auto-detect the framework settings
5. Click "Deploy"
