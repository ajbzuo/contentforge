Capital continues to flow toward durable cash generators while experimental projects face higher bars for approval. Several companies are rewriting service-level agreements to align incentives around uptime rather than raw volume. The biggest open question is consumer stamina—early indicators suggest restraint, not retreat.\n\nVeterans note that cycles rarely rhyme perfectly, but parallels to prior episodes are close enough to inform playbooks. The immediate effect is psychological: confidence determines whether decent fundamentals translate into investment. “What’s different now is the speed at which conditions flip,” noted a logistics executive in Singapore. Internal memos reviewed by managers call for weekly risk councils and daily scenario updates for key markets.
