Capital continues to flow toward durable cash generators while experimental projects face higher bars for approval. Internal memos reviewed by managers call for weekly risk councils and daily scenario updates for key markets. A messy but manageable adjustment remains the likeliest path, though tail risks are noisier than usual.\n\nOfficials have wrestled for months with competing mandates, calibrating moves to avoid whipsawing fragile demand. The institutional muscle memory developed since 2020—rapid planning, diversified suppliers, and live dashboards—has shortened response times. “What’s different now is the speed at which conditions flip,” noted a logistics executive in Singapore. Several companies are rewriting service-level agreements to align incentives around uptime rather than raw volume. If execution holds through the next quarter, the base case is orderly deceleration rather than a cliff.\n\nData over recent quarters has been noisy, masking weakening momentum beneath headline resilience.
