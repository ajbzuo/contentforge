Internal memos reviewed by managers call for weekly risk councils and daily scenario updates for key markets. A messy but manageable adjustment remains the likeliest path, though tail risks are noisier than usual.\n\nData over recent quarters has been noisy, masking weakening momentum beneath headline resilience. Balance sheets are sturdier than during the last shock, yet risk appetite has narrowed to proven categories. “Our customers are pragmatic; they want reliability over theatrics,” said the head of procurement at a large retailer. Lenders are tightening covenants modestly but prioritizing relationships with long-tenured clients.
