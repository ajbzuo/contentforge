The institutional muscle memory developed since 2020—rapid planning, diversified suppliers, and live dashboards—has shortened response times.

Policy choices over the next two meetings will determine whether relief becomes a trend or a pause.\n\nVeterans note that cycles rarely rhyme perfectly, but parallels to prior episodes are close enough to inform playbooks. The immediate effect is psychological: confidence determines whether decent fundamentals translate into investment. “What’s different now is the speed at which conditions flip,” noted a logistics executive in Singapore.
